## Calculation of Pi Using the Monte Carlo Method

The "Monte Carlo Method" is a method of solving problems using statistics. Given the probability, P, that an event will occur in certain conditions, a computer can be used to generate those conditions repeatedly. The number of times the event occurs divided by the number of times the conditions are generated should be approximately equal to P

We are using Monte Carlo method to estimate a value of Pi.
